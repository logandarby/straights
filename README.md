# straights

A school project focused on implementing OOP principles and design patterns in a command-line Straights game.

## Installing

Simply run `make` on your system, and then run the produced `straights` file.

## Pre-Concieved Design

This project was concieved from the ground up before implementation. `project-spec.md` contains the specifications for the game. `plan.md` contains a project timeline, and aswers to various OOP oriented questions. Finally, `uml.pdf` is a complete UML diagram of the pre-conceived class structure used.

## Final Design

After completing the project, I reflected on my design in the following files. `src/uml-final.pdf` contains a final UML diagram accurate to the codebase. `design.pdf` is a full report reflecting on my OOP design decisions, what I did well, and what I could change. Finally, `demo.pdf` takes the user of the program through a quick tour of the program.
