# Plan Notes

## Grading

- Correctness/Completeness - 60%
- Documentation - 20%
- Design - 20%

#### Correctness/Completeness

- On DD2, submit `demo.pdf` which takes TA on a tour of all required features
- Include how to use command line arguments/input files whatever
- If a feature doesn't work, say so explicitly
- The code *MUST* compile (otherwise 0%)
- **EC**: Plan to implement any addition features

#### Documentation/Design

- Must have good OOP design principles
- Minimize coupling (degree of direct knowledge one lement has of another)
- Maximize cohesion (degree to which elements inside a mmodule belong together)
- Plan for change (w/ minimal modification to OG program)
- Outline ways in which your design accomodates new features and changes to existing features. Be specific

## Due Date 1

#### UML Diagram

- `uml.pdf`
- UML class diagram (ancitipating structure)
- Show relationships (assoc, composition, aggregation, etc.)
- You need to only show public methods (show private/protected to show design patterns)
- Don't show big 5 ops, constructors, setters/getters
- You aren't required to adhere strictly to this model. Just a rough guideline

#### Plan of Attack

- `plan.pdf`
- A basic plan of attack
- What to do first, second, and so on
- Rough completion dates
- You will have to explain why you deviate from this plan
- Include answers to all questions listed within the project spec
- No more than 5pgs long

## Due Date 2

A zip file, everything is in the "root" directory. Also, re-download it to make **absolutely sure it compiles**

- All code, with a Makefile
  - Employ good OOP
- `demo.pdf`
- Final design document
- Updated UML class
  - `uml-final.pdf`

#### Final Design Document

- `design.pdf`
- Outline final design of project, show how it differed on DD1
- Include all answers to questions in project spec, and how they differ in DD1
- TA shouldn't have to read through all code (but you can 'cite' certain parts)
- most important part: how your design accomodates change, and discuss cohesion and coupling of modules
  - MOST of the design grade is THIS PART
- The following questions:
  - a) what lessons did you learn about writing large programs?
  - b) What would you have done differently if you had the chance to start over?

###### Structure

- 5-10 pages
- Organize into:
  - Intro (if needed)
  - Overview (overall structure)
  - Design (describe specific techniques to solve various design challenges)
  - Resilience to Change (how it supports possibility of various changes to program spec)
  - Answers to Questions (in project spec)
  - Extra Credit Features (what you did, why they were challenging, how you solved them)
  - Final Questions
    - What lessons did you learn, what would you have done differently?
  - Conclusion (if needed)
- Used for both documentation mark and design mark
- This is 40% of the grade !!!
